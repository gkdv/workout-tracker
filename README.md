# workout-tracker
For this app a was given front end code and had to wire up the backend functionality. I used a mongoDB with a mongoose schema. I used express to wire up the routes.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.

## How it works

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout, or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

-   Add exercises to a previous workout plan.
    
-   Add new exercises to a new workout plan.
    
-   View multiple the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page. 
- You can get the the stats page by adding /stats to the url.
